# All the C examples

To run this code there is a Makefile with simple shortcuts

- `sudo make`: will compile the Bare Minimum file
- `sudo make struct`: will compile the Struct Response file
- `sudo make check`: will compile the Checksum file.
- `sudo make clean`: of corse will remove the binary file after compilation.

You can use the following combo `sudo make && sudo ./ping.out && make clean` to:

1. compile
2. run the code
3. delete the unnecessary file
